<h1 align="center">School District Analysis</h1>

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to summarize the student's math and reading performance by schools in the district. The performance was also measured by grade, by school spending, by school size, and by school type. Furthermore, the analysis has examined the impact of removing the 9th grade reading and math scores from the Thomas High School ("THS"), give suspected cheating activity. 

## Results
Due to the removal of the the reading and math scores for the ninth-grade at THS, the passing rates of THS have changed. The screenshots below show the "before" and "after" data (the "before" view is on the top and the "after" view is on the bottom) by categories. 

* District Summary: Given that the number of students subtracted from the total student counts is relatively small (461), there are no significant impact on the district summary data.All passing percentages only decreased very slightly.

* School Summary: The passing percentages for math, reading, and overall (math and reading) for THS have increased slightly. The average math score has decreased, while the average reading score had increased.

* THS's performance relative to the other schools: Among all schools, THS's ranking based on the overall passing rate did not change, still the second highest.

* Math and reading scores by grade: Since the 9th-grade scores were removed for THS, there was no math or reading scores for this grade for THS to participate the comparison.

* Scores by school spending: Passing rates reading and overall in the $630-644 categories have both decreased by 0.1%, reflecting that THS belongs to this category.

* Scores by school size: Reading passing rates in the medium sized school have decreased by 0.1%, reflecting that that THS belongs to this category.

* Scores by school type: Give the large number of students in each type of schools, passing rates by school type did not significantly change.

## Summary
Four major changes in the updated school district analysis are:
1. Clearly the by grade analysis changed mostly noticeably as the ninth-grade scores for THS were completely missing.
2. THS overall performance was worsened but not significantly enough to impact the school's ranking in the district.
3. Passing percentages by school spending was impacted.
4. Passing percentages by school size was impacted.
