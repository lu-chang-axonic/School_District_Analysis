<h1 align="center">School District Analysis</h1>

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to summarize the student's math and reading performance by schools in the district. The performance was also measured by grade, by school spending, by school size, and by school type. Furthermore, the analysis has examined the impact of removing the 9th grade reading and math scores from the Thomas High School ("THS"), give suspected cheating activity. 

## Results
Due to the removal of the the reading and math scores for the nith grade at THS, the passing rates of THS have changed. The screenshot below shows the before and after data. 

The changed passing rates have the following impacts on the summary tables:

* District Summary: Given that the number of students subtracted from the total student counts is relatively small (461), there are no significant impact on the district summary data. All passing percentages only decreased very slightly, as shown below (the "before" view is on the top and the "after" view is on the bottom).

* School Summary: The passing pecentages for math, reading, and math and reading for THS have increased.
* THS's performance relative to the other schools: Among all schools, THS's ranking based on the overall passing rate have increased from #3 from the bottom to top #3.
* Math and reading scores by grade: Clearly, since the 9th grade scores were removed for THS, there was no math or reading scores for this grade for THS to participate the comparison.
* Scores by school spending: Passing rates in the $630-644 categories have changed, reflecting that THS belongs to this category. 
* Scores by school size: Passing rates in the medium sized school have changed, reflecting that that THS belongs to this category. 
* Scores by school type: Passing rates in the charter school have changed, reflecting that that THS belongs to this category.
